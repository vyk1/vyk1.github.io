The year was 2020. I've started designing using Adobe XD.

Three years later I've found their published versions and thought it would be a great idea to write this post to keep this historical data (and also because it can be handy, someday).

### [Meu Trabalho AcadÃªmico](https://xd.adobe.com/view/afde546c-788b-4c7a-8bd6-6ad5daf37f1c-fa8d/)

### [APAE SACI - Curitibanos - SC:](https://xd.adobe.com/view/018fe649-8202-4d02-9f8d-2ae006cd3044-54dc/)
